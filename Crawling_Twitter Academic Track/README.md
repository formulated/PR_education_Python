- This Python Script on Jupyter notebook is for crawling Tweets by using Twitter API for academic researchers (Academic Research product track). To use it, you have to apply for the track (read https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-the-new-academic-research-product-track/148632).

- This code is based on Twitter-providing Python code to look-up Tweets (https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/blob/master/Tweet-Lookup/get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py).

- The code I provided here helps researchers to conveniently get full Tweet texts just by changing parameters such as keyword and date. If a tweet is retweet, it is truncated and hard to get the full-length text, which is almost hidden. Thus, this code was designed to get a full-length text.
